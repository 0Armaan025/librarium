          <li>I created this website as a wrapper of libgen.is books.</li>
          <li>
            Please don't complain if you don't find the book ðŸ¥¹, as I don't have
            a big database.
          </li>

          <li>
            I'm just getting data from libgen.is, but soon I'll try to find a
            way to get data from anna-archive too, for a bigger database.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am aware that there are a lot of bugs/errors, and I'm working on
            fixing them, you can def. report in the feedback section! ðŸ˜„
          </li>
          <li>
            After a few days, make sure to check
            "the-words-of-the-unknown.vercel.app" too, a website where
            "anonymous" can write a status/message they want to convey, perhaps
            "anon-speaks.vercel.app" is a better name? ðŸ¤” do let me know in the
            feedback thingy.
          </li>
          <li>I def. didn't take any help from ChatGPT (that's a lie).</li>
          <li>
            If you think this is hard to make, you're wrong, this is a child's
            game, this is super easy to create and anyone can do it including
            you.
